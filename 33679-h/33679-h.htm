<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>The designer of this bulletin first had in mind something of the sort
for the use of his students, not only the undergraduates, but others
living on farms, or teaching in Michigan and elsewhere. Whoever
grows seeds to sell, or buys seeds to sow, should be benefited by consulting
the illustrations which are unsurpassed for accuracy by anything
in this country. They were all made by Mr. F. H. Hillman. A hand
lens costing from twenty cents to a dollar is almost <ins title="Original was indespensible.">indispensable</ins> in
examining our seeds. The brief descriptions are necessarily made by
using definite scientific terms, which are explained in a glossary at
the close of the work. A few weeds are not illustrated, for the reason
that the plants have ceased to produce seeds, such as the horse radish,
and some of them are not conspicuously bad. Not far from half the
illustrations are made from small seed-like fruits, likely to be mistaken
for seeds, such as are produced by dandelions, burdocks, narrow-leaved
dock, all grasses. Cuts of seeds of several clovers are inserted that
students may learn to distinguished them from weeds too often mixed
with them.</p>

<p>No apology is offered for making use of the decimal scale instead
of the cumbersome antiquated English scale, which fortunately is
gradually growing out of use. In the back part of the bulletin are
duplicate copies of the decimal scale that any one can cut out and use
for measuring.</p>

<p>For copies of the following figures some time ago prepared by Mr.
Hillman, we are indebted to the authorities of the Agricultural College,
of Reno, Nevada: 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39,

95, 97, 98, 99, 108, 110, 116, 125, 130, 135, 138, 140, 144, 146, 152, 153,

<p>Weeds everywhere; they thrive in the cornfield, they choke wheat
in the field, they annoy the <ins title="May be gardener.">gardner</ins>, they thrive in the meadow, they
spring up by the roadside, they encroach on the swamp, they damage
the fleeces of sheep. The rapid increase in the number and variety of
weeds should cause alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<h3>DISADVANTAGES OF WEEDS.</h3>

<p>1. They rob cultivated plants of nutriment.</p>

<p>2. They injure crops by crowding and shading.</p>

<p>3. They retard the work of harvesting grain by increasing the draft
and by extra wear of machinery. (Bindweed, thistles, red root.)</p>

<p>4. They retard the drying of grain and hay.</p>

<p>5. They increase the labor of threshing, and make cleaning of seed
difficult.</p>

<p>6. They damage the quality of flour, sometimes making it nearly
worthless. (Allium vineale L.)</p>

<p>7. Most of them are of little value as food for domestic animals.</p>

<p>8. Some weeds injure stock by means of barbed awns. (Squirrel
tail grass, wild oats, porcupine grass.)</p>

<p>9. Some of them injure wool and disfigure the tails of cattle, the
manes and tails of horses. (Burdock, cocklebur, houndstongue.)</p>

<p>10. A few make "Hair balls" in the stomachs of horses. (Rabbit-foot
clover, crimson clover.)</p>

<p>11. Some injure the quality of dairy products. (Leeks, wild onions.)</p>

<p>12. Penny cress, and probably others, when eaten by animals, injure
the taste of meat.</p>

<p>13. Poison hemlock, spotted cowbane and Jamestown weed are very
poisonous.</p>

<p>14. Many weeds interfere with a rotation of crops.</p>

<p>15. All weeds damage the appearance of a farm and render it less
valuable. (Quack-grass, Canada thistle, plantains.)</p>


<h3>SOME SMALL BENEFITS.</h3>

<p>1. They are of some use in the world to induce more frequent and
more thorough cultivation, which benefits crops.</p>

<p>2. The new arrival of a weed of first rank stimulates watchfulness.
(Russian thistle.)</p>

<p>3. In occupying the soil after a crop has been removed they prevent
the loss of fertility by shading the ground.</p>

<p>4. Weeds plowed under add some humus and fertility to the soil,
though in a very much less degree than clover or cow peas.</p>

<p>5. Some of them furnish food for birds in winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<h3>WHAT ENABLES A PLANT TO BECOME A WEED.</h3>

<p>1. Sometimes by producing an enormous number of <ins title="May be seeds.">weeds</ins>. (A large
plant of purslane, 1,250,000 seeds; a patch of daisy fleabane, 3,000 to
a square inch.)</p>

<p>2. In other cases by the great vitality of their seeds. Shepherd's
purse, mustard, purslane, pigeon-grass, pigweeds, pepper-grass, May
weed, evening primrose, smart weed, narrow-leaved dock, two chick-weeds
survive when buried in the soil thirty years at least, as I have
found by actual test.</p>

<p>3. In each prickly fruit of a cocklebur there are two seeds, only
one of which grows the first year, the other surviving to grow the
second year.</p>

<p>4. Some are very succulent, and ripen seeds even when pulled. (Purslane.)</p>

<p>5. Often by ripening and scattering seeds before the cultivated crop
is mature. (Red root, fleabane.)</p>

<p>6. Sometimes by ripening seeds at the time of harvesting a crop,
when all are harvested together. (Chess, cockle.)</p>

<p>7. Some seeds are difficult to separate from seeds of the crop cultivated.
(Sorrel, mustard, narrow-leaved plantain in seeds of red clover
and alfalfa.)</p>

<p>8. Some are very small and escape notice. (Mullein, fleabane.)</p>

<p>9. Some plants go to seed long before suspected, as no showy flowers
announce the time of bloom. (Pigweeds.)</p>

<p>10. In a few cases the plants break loose from the soil when mature
and become tumble-weeds. (Some pigweeds, Russian thistle.)</p>

<p>11. Some seeds and seed-like fruits are furnished each with a balloon,
or a sail, or with grappling hooks. (Dandelion, sticktights, burdock.)</p>

<p>12. Some remain with the dead plant long into winter, and when
torn off by the wind or by birds, drift for long distances on the snow,
often from one farm to another. (Pigweeds.)</p>

<p>13. Some have creeping root-stocks or tubers. (Quack-grass, nut-grass.)</p>

<p>14. Some defend themselves with forks and bayonets. (Thistles.)</p>

<p>15. Most of them are disagreeable in taste or odor, so that domestic
animals leave them to occupy the ground and multiply. (Jamestown
weed, stink grass, milk weed.)</p>

<p>16. Plants with stout roots are sometimes passed over by the harrow
or cultivator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<h3>HOW ARE WEEDS INTRODUCED AND HOW ARE THEY
SPREAD?</h3>

<p>1. By live stock, carried in the hair or fleece or carried by the feet;
in some instances passing alive with the excrement.</p>

<p>2. By unground feed-stuff purchased.</p>

<p>3. By adhering to the insides of sacks where they were placed with
grain.</p>

<p>4. In barnyard manure drawn from town.</p>

<p>5. In the packing of trees, crockery, baled hay and straw.</p>

<p>6. By wagons, sleighs, threshing machines.</p>

<p>7. Sometimes by plows, cultivators and harrows.</p>

<p>8. By railway trains passing through or near a farm.</p>

<p>9. By ballast of boats at wharves.</p>

<p>10. By wool-waste at factories.</p>

<p>11. By birds, squirrels, and mice.</p>

<p>12. By water of brooks, rivers, by washing rains and by irrigating
ditches.</p>

<p>13. By the wind aided by little wings or down, or by drifting on
the snow.</p>

<p>14. By dropping seeds to the ground from extending branches and
repeating the process.</p>

<p>15. By creeping root-stocks, as June grass, quack-grass and toad-flax.</p>

<p>16. By piercing potatoes, carrots, etc., quack-grass, June grass, Bermuda
grass are sometimes carried to other fields or farms where the
tubers and roots are planted.</p>

<p>17. A farmer buys clover seeds or grass seeds that were grown in
some state that never before grew seeds that went onto his farm and
thus he may get some new weeds. Seeds of alfalfa or some other crop
bring new kinds of weeds, especially those of dodder. As every kind
of weed goes onto a farm to stay there it follows that as a country
becomes older the greater the number of kinds of weeds. As a rule
each farm is annually getting more sorts of weeds, and as each farmer
is cultivating weeds, they are more freely distributed in every field
and along every roadside and by exchanging they are carried to neighboring
and distant farms.</p>

<p>A great many farmers buy and sow whatever the merchant offers
them under the name mentioned. For example, the college has a sample
of something called clover seed, sold by a dealer in this state. It
contains about 40 per cent of narrow-leaved plantain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<h3>WHERE CERTAIN WEEDS ARE TROUBLESOME.</h3>

<p>To begin with, years and years ago no new farm in the wilderness
of Michigan contained more than twenty to thirty-five kinds of weeds,
as there were not more than thirty-five sorts in the entire state, while
at present there are not far from 250 kinds. A large majority of weeds
hail from older countries, more especially from Europe.</p>

<p>There are a few weeds, like Canada thistle and quack-grass, that
may infest any crop of farm or garden, but in most cases, whether to
call a weed very bad depends on the nature of the crop grown, the size of
the weed-seeds and their time of ripening.</p>

<p>Some weeds have a very wide distribution, thriving all around the
world in temperate climates, while others are more limited in range;
some thrive only in dry, thin, sandy soil and others in wet soils. To
some extent the presence of a few weed-seeds is almost as objectionable
when once on the farm, as though there were more, because these few
may thrive and seed freely.</p>

<p>In many respects the lists of weeds for New Jersey is different from
the list in Michigan, while half the weeds of Nevada or Oregon are
not known in our state.</p>

<p>Chess, cockle, red root and rye are liable to be troublesome in fields
of winter wheat, because the seeds are more or less difficult to separate
from this grain and for the reason that they require a portion of two
years to come to maturity.</p>

<p>Meadows and pastures, especially where the land is not fertile, abound
in weeds that require two years or more to produce seeds, such as narrow-leaved
dock, bitter dock, bull thistle, carrot, teasel, two kinds of
mulleins, night-flowering catchfly, evening primrose, several kinds of fleabane,
ox-eye daisy, orange hawkweed, two or three kinds of plantain,
Canada thistle, hound's tongue, stick seed, sow thistle, horse nettle,
buttercups, toad flax, silvery cinquefoil, and many more, not excluding
some annuals, like crab-grass, tickle grass, pigeon grasses. As crops
of corn, potatoes, beans, turnips, beets and squashes are ready to harvest
at the close of one growing season they are molested more or less by
pigeon grasses, several pigweeds, purslane, crab-grass, barnyard grass,
tickle grass and a number of others.</p>

<p>In 1897 some seventy-five lots of timothy seeds were examined and
the following list of twenty-four species of weeds were found. Doubtless
other weeds may still be found in other lots of timothy seed. No
sample was entirely free from weeds. Pepper grass was most common,
next followed tumble weed and then shepherd's purse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amaranthus graecizans, Tumble weed.</li>
<li>Amaranthus retroflexus, Rough pigweed.</li>
<li>Anthemis Cotula, May weed.</li>
<li>Brassica arvensis, Charlock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Brassica nigra, Black mustard.</li>
<li>Bursa Bursa-pastoris, Shepherd's purse.</li>
<li>Carduus arvensis, Canada thistle.</li>
<li>Carex straminea. A kind of sedge.</li>
<li>Chenopodium album, Pigweed.</li>
<li>Chenopodium filicifolium, Another kind of pigweed.</li>
<li>Lactuca Canadensis, Wild Lettuce.</li>
<li>Lepidium Virginicum, Wild Pepper-grass.</li>
<li>Onagra biennis, Evening primrose.</li>
<li>Panicum capillare, Hair grass, tickle grass.</li>
<li>Plantago lanceolata, Narrow-leaved plantain.</li>
<li>Plantago Rugelii, Rugel's Plantain, one of the broad-leaved plantains.</li>
<li>Poa compressa, Flat-stemmed poa, wire grass.</li>
<li>Potentilla Monspeliensis, Rough cinquefoil.</li>
<li>Prunella vulgaris, Self-heal.</li>
<li>Rumex Acetocella, Field or sheep sorrel.</li>
<li>Sisymbrium officinale, Hedge mustard.</li>
<li>Verbena angustifolia, Narrow-leaved vervain.</li>
<li>Verbena hastata, Blue vervain.</li>
<li>Verbena urticifolia, White vervain.</li>
</ul>

<p>In examining some 130 lots of clover seeds as found in the market
during 1897, thirty-two kinds of weed seeds were found. Sheep
sorrel was most common, next to this yellow or bitter dock and green
foxtail. Only three samples of clover seed was free from weeds, but
possibly some weeds might have been seen if larger quantities had been
looked over.</p>

<p>During the year 1908, eleven years later, 47 kinds of weed seeds were
found in 122 lots of seed of red clover, a gain of nearly 50 per cent.</p>

<p>During three months from January 1, 1910, in examining 450 lots of
seeds of grasses, clovers and alfalfas, besides large numbers of common
weeds that we know, were 74 kinds not known to the writer. Of these
74 kinds, probably some will never become weeds of any account. Some
of these came with alfalfa from Montana and some were importations
from Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Parasitic fungi rank as weeds; such as rusts and smuts of wheat,
oats, corn; apple scab, black knot of plum, brown rot of cherry, anthracnose
of beans.</p>


<h3>SOME MEANS FOR PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF
WEEDS AND A FEW RULES FOR
THEIR EXTERMINATION.</h3>

<p>1. The right kind of a man, who will carefully observe and study
the kinds of weeds and their habits, fighting each to the best advantage,
i. e. with method.</p>

<p>2. See that all seeds purchased or grown at home for seed are free
from seeds of weeds. Although often heard, these words are too little
heeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>3. See that threshing machines, hay racks, grain bags from other
farms are well cleaned before used on the farm.</p>

<p>4. Cook or grind screenings and burn chaff when certain weeds are
suspected.</p>

<p>5. Send seeds to the Agricultural College, East Lansing, for identification,
unless they are known to be harmless.</p>

<p>6. Strive to prevent weeds from ripening seeds. This is especially
important late in the season in case of all pigweeds, purslane and others
where the flowers are very small and are liable to be overlooked and
the seeds ripen before their presence is suspected.</p>

<p>7. For meadow or pasture make the soil very fertile, as most weeds
will then be killed or crowded by the better grass and become of little
account.</p>

<p>8. Modify the rotation of crops with reference to killing the weeds.</p>

<p>9. Make a specialty of hoed or cultivated crops.</p>

<p>10. Make soiling crops a prominent feature in certain fields.</p>

<p>11. Smother weeds with quick growing and thickly seeded crops,
like red clover or rye or buckwheat.</p>

<p>12. Keep some crops growing on the land from early spring till late
autumn,&mdash;double cropping, i. e., two cultivated crops in one year for
barn and cellar instead of one for use and one of weeds.</p>

<p>13. Cultivate thoroughly after a crop is removed.</p>

<p>14. Clean up and avoid leaving any vacant or out of the way places
for breeding ground.</p>

<p>15. Where practicable, remove fences and cultivate to the gutters
of the highway.</p>

<p>16. Keep some sheep.</p>

<p>17. When once begun, continue the work thoroughly from year to
year, giving no quarter to weeds. This is the easiest in the long run
and the royal way.</p>

<p>18. Where hand labor is employed, it is far less expensive and much
easier to keep weeds down by raking or hoeing once a week than by
going over the ground much less frequently.</p>

<p>The habits of a weed determine to a great extent the best mode of
fighting it. Certain remedies suggest themselves for creeping perennials,
like quack grass and toad flax, while different treatment is best for narrow-leaved
dock; and still a different mode of attack may be adopted
for crab grass and purslane.</p>

<p>Weeds are annuals, as pigweeds, crab grass, purslane; biennials as
bull thistle and mulleins; perennials, like quack grass, Canada thistle,
ox-eye Daisy.</p>

<p>Will it pay? The annual cost of successfully fighting a weedy farm
of 100 acres in Ontario has been found to be about $75. Good cultivation
in the long run pays a greater profit than slipshod culture. It not
only kills the weeds, but keeps the soil in condition for securing good
crops. It conserves moisture.</p>

<p>Perennial plants cannot gain any if the green leaves are not allowed
to appear. The nourishment stored in the root stocks underground will
aid the plant to send up slender leaves and if these remain, the plants
gain and recruit, but if the leaves start underground and are cut off
before coming to the light, these root stocks are drawn on again to furnish
food to start more leaves and thus, in time become exhausted.</p>

the awn untwists more or less; twisting and untwisting
the beards hold what the beak pierces,

upon the degree their ripeness or the amount of
threshing to which they have been subjected.
See the figure of this species. Seeds granular,
circular, dull, jet-black, or gray in case the thin
ovary remains, 1.3&ndash;1.7 mm. in diameter, lower
face convex, the upper slightly convex if mature,
with a slight notch on the rounded edge,
the lower face bearing a slight curved groove, leading from the notch to
near the center, the upper face with a light spot at the center. Introduced
